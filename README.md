Usage
Data Cleaning: The script data_cleaning.py performs data cleaning, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Run EDA_and_analysis.ipynb for a step-by-step guide on visualizing and analyzing the data.

Modeling: The model.py script builds machine learning models for sales prediction and customer segmentation.

Visualization: Visualize trends in sales, customer demographics, and product performance using charts generated by EDA_and_analysis.ipynb.

Example Output
A prediction model that estimates future sales based on historical transaction data.
Customer segments identified using clustering algorithms for personalized marketing.
Trend graphs for sales and product performance across different time periods.
